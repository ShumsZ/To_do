# Priority based to-do list 
### Really just an excuse to implement a sorting algorithm...

Fair warning, there is no GUI for this to-do list (yet). This is solely a terminal application made using Python

This program emulates the idea of a simple to do list where a user can add items to a list and assign a priority for each item. The priority can be any number.
The program then uses Merge Sort to arrange the priorities and the user is displayed with a dictionary of items in descending order.
